# About me 👋

**兔子帮/llTZBll** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my undergraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about high-dimensional data processing, few-shot learning, incremental learning, and zero-shot learning.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with people who are eager to learn new things, just like me.
- 💬 Ask me about anything (as long as it's not too offensive!).
