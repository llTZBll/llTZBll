# About me ðŸ‘‹

**llTZBll/llTZBll** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my undergraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about high-dimensional data processing, few-shot learning, incremental learning, and zero-shot learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people who are eager to learn new things, just like me.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything (as long as it's not too offensive!).
